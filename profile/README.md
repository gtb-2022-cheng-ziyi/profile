#  Welcome to Zoey‘s org

Hi, let me introduce myself to you.

I'm Ziyi Cheng, you can call me Zoey as well.

This is me in 2021:

I love ACG, especially animations, and usually watch them on bilibili.

I love painting. Painting is a good way to kill time, and keep myself relaxed.

I'd like to show same of my watercolor paintings to you:

I also use procreate to do some drawing works:
